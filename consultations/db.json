A string of these blood vessels connects you to your baby and will become the umbilical cord. At the same time, the embryo's outer layer of cells develops a groove and folds to form a hollow tube called the neural tube. This will become your baby's brain and spinal cord. Defects in one end (the `tail end`) of the neural tube lead to spina bifida. Defects in the `head end` lead to anencephaly, when the bones of the skull do not form properly.
